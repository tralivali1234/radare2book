## Block Size

The block size determines how many bytes Radare commands will process when not given an explicit size argument. You can temporarily change the block size by specifying a numeric argument to the print commands. For example `px 20`.

    [0xB7F9D810]> b?
    |Usage: b[f] [arg]
    Get/Set block size
    | b        display current block size
    | b 33     set block size to 33
    | b+3      increase blocksize by 3
    | b-16     decrease blocksize by 16
    | b eip+4  numeric argument can be an expression
    | bf foo   set block size to flag size
    | bm 1M    set max block size

The `b` command is used to change the block size:

    [0x00000000]> b 0x100   ; block size = 0x100
    [0x00000000]> b +16     ;  ... = 0x110
    [0x00000000]> b -32     ;  ... = 0xf0
    
The `bf` command is used to change the block size to value specified by a flag. For example, in symbols, the block size of the flag represents the size of the function.

    [0x00000000]> bf sym.main    ; block size = sizeof(sym.main)
    [0x00000000]> pd @ sym.main  ; disassemble sym.main
    ...

You can combine two operations in a single one (`pdf`):

     [0x00000000]> pdf @ sym.main
