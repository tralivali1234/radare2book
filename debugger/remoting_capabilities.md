# Remote Access Capabilities

Radare can be run locally, or it can be started as a server process which is controlled by a local
radare2 process. This is possible because everything uses radare's IO subsystem which abstracts access to system(), cmd() and all basic IO operations so to work over a network.

Help for commands useful for remote access to radare:

    [0x00405a04]> =?
    |Usage:  =[:!+-=hH] [...] # radare remote command execution protocol
    |
    rap commands:
    | =                  list all open connections
    | =<[fd] cmd         send output of local command to remote fd
    | =[fd] cmd          exec cmd at remote 'fd' (last open is default one)
    | =! cmd             run command via r_io_system
    | =+ [proto://]host  add host (default=rap://, tcp://, udp://)
    | =-[fd]             remove all hosts or host 'fd'
    | ==[fd]             open remote session with host 'fd', 'q' to quit
    | =!=                disable remote cmd mode
    | !=!                enable remote cmd mode
    |
    rap server:
    | =:port             listen on given port using rap protocol (o rap://9999)
    | =&:port            start rap server in background
    | =:host:port cmd    run 'cmd' command on remote server
    |
    http server:
    | =h port            listen for http connections (r2 -qc=H /bin/ls)
    | =h-                stop background webserver
    | =h*                restart current webserver
    | =h& port           start http server in background)
    | =H port            launch browser and listen for http
    | =H& port           launch browser and listen for http in background
    |
    gdbserver:
    | =g port file       listen on 'port' debugging 'file' using gdbserver
    | =g! port file      same as above, but debug protocol messages (like gdbserver --remote-debug)

You can learn radare2 remote capabilities by displaying the list of supported IO plugins: `radare2 -L`.

A little example should make this clearer. A typical remote session might look like this:

At the remote host1:

    $ radare2 rap://:1234

At the remote host2:

    $ radare2 rap://:1234

At localhost:

    $ radare2 -

; Add hosts

    [0x004048c5]> =+ rap://<host1>:1234//bin/ls
    Connected to: <host1> at port 1234
    waiting... ok

    [0x004048c5]> =
    0 - rap://<host1>:1234//bin/ls

You can open remote files in debug mode (or using any IO plugin) specifying URI when adding hosts:

    [0x004048c5]> =+ =+ rap://<host2>:1234/dbg:///bin/ls
    Connected to: <host2> at port 1234
    waiting... ok
    0 - rap://<host1>:1234//bin/ls
    1 - rap://<host2>:1234/dbg:///bin/ls

To execute commands on host1:

    [0x004048c5]> =0 px
    [0x004048c5]> = s 0x666

To open a session with host2:

    [0x004048c5]> ==1
    fd:6> pi 1
    ...
    fd:6> q

To remove hosts (and close connections):

    [0x004048c5]> =-

You can also redirect radare output to a TCP or UDP server (such as `nc -l`). First, Add the server with '=+ tcp://' or '=+ udp://', then you can redirect the output of a command to be sent to the server:

     [0x004048c5]> =+ tcp://<host>:<port>/
    Connected to: <host> at port <port>
    5 - tcp://<host>:<port>/
    [0x004048c5]> =<5 cmd...

The `=<' command will send the output from the execution of `cmd` to the remote connection number N (or the last one used if no id specified).
